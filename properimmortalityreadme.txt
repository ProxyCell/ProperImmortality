This mod will provide you with access to the Immortal trait in the Character Customizer or whatever mods you want to include it with. It importantly includes a completed localisation file and a trait icon file already setup in this package.

Note on the icon: I took it from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_Trefoil_Knot.png and it is public domain.

No license, no copyrights, just do whatever you want with it.
